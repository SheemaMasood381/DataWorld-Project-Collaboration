# Soccer League Database (EDA) Match Outcome Prediction

This project is part of the DataWorld Project Collaboration. The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a soccer league database and build a model to predict match outcomes.

## Project Overview

### Dataset Details

- **Dataset Name:** Soccer League Database
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Soccer Database](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer)
- **Description:** The dataset contains detailed information on over 25,000 soccer matches from the top European leagues. It includes data on match outcomes, team statistics, player statistics, and more.

### The project involves:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing the dataset to uncover patterns and trends in match outcomes.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating features that can help improve the accuracy of the prediction model.
- **Model Building:** Developing and evaluating machine learning models to predict match outcomes.
- **Visualization:** Creating visualizations to communicate the findings and insights from the analysis.

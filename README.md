# DataWorld Project Collaboration

This repository is part of my collaboration with **DataWorld**. It contains the project files and ongoing work for the collaboration. The main goal of this project is to explore and analyze data to gain valuable insights.

## Project Overview


Project 01: Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project is the first in a series of projects in collaboration with Data World. The goal is to analyze the dataset to gain insights into transaction patterns and identify potential factors that distinguish fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones.

#### Dataset Details
- **Dataset Name:** Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Description:** The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for 0.172% of all transactions.


The project involves:
- **Data Analysis**: Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends.
- **Fraud Detection**: Building and evaluating models to detect fraudulent transactions.
- **Visualization**: Creating meaningful visualizations for data interpretation.

### Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
